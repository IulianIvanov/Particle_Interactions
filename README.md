# Particle_Interactions
 
The aim of this project is to predict the best possible the trajectory of n corps using a neural network. In this work, we introduce a graph convoluted network (GCN), an unsupervised model that learns to infer interactions while simultaneously learning the dynamics purely from observational data.
